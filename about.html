             Name is Aisha Fadalla (Kaka).<br> I grew up in a family of seven children and I am the first born in a family o seven.<br>
             Being the first born I never enjoyed my childhood because my parents were busy all the time and I had all 
            <br>the responsibility of the house work as well as taking care of my young ones.<br> 
            I am from Sudan,in a region called Nuba Mountain.I love where I come from because my people live  with respect,unity,
            <br>care and love. However, I dislike some of the culture and I feel like  as the <br>new/young generation should change that for our area to develop for better.
            <br><b>Hobbies</b><br>
            Cooking, Tralvering, swimming, Taking pictuers playing volley ball and computing.  
            
            <br><b>My values</b> <br>
                I came to discover that having our own personal values are really important because it will always help us remember what we have to do to get the values.
                
                <br><b>My top three values are:</b> <br>
                Freedom.
                I believe that for me to be happy and live my own life, I need to be free, have rights to do what I love when I want. I am not okay with the way women in my communiy are treated. 
                Accountability.
                In everything I do like being responsible and accountable for it no matter what.
                Independence.
                I don't like asking for help all the time and am used to trying to solve or look for aways before asking others because I believe that if others can solve it, who am I not to try?
                Message To My Follow Ladies.
                Believe in yourself that you will make it and always take part in those activities that men think we can't do, be kind to yourself and others as well,speck up your mind and be ready for change knowing that life is not constant.

             <h3> MY JOURNEY</h3>           
        <p class="camp">
           <b>
            I left my homeland in the year 2013 and travelled in Kenya for my high school education in Kitale but I stayed with my relatives in Eldoret but after sometime,
            life forced me to move to Kakuma Refugees Camp where I got an opportunity and started working there to support my younger brother and myself. 
            Living in the Camp and away from my homeland,I had a rough life and have thought multiple times that it would never get better.
            But as i got used to the environment and got older,
            I realized that the struggle I go through makes me who I am,
            because on the ground things are not easy since we are depending on the UN for all support. Sometimes,
            the food and education they provide is not enough so you have to look for other ways to earn income, however small.
            I always believe that I am a strong woman because of what I went through and still go through even if I feel like giving up.
            When I remember all the responsibilities which are awaiting me, I get stronger and  move on .I have hope that things will be better.
