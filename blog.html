    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>In Born crime Trevor Noah used  humor to show how he always got himself out of 
        <br>danger wherever he made a mistake to his mother Patricaia. He would run away 
        <br>and his mother world ran after him until she caught him or failed to, therefore he referred<br>
         to the way they joke with each other in the house as a “Tom and Jerry relationship”. Page:10</strong></p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        In page:43, Trevor used the kitchen scene where he shits on a newspaper where he says<br> 
        it helped him to overcome the problem of being hit by rain and he describes as the best
         <br>experiences I find this part humor. The prayer which he says when his mother finds<br> 
         the shit in the bin also shows humor and this prayer helps him to escape the problem <br>that was 
         to arise in case he was found guilty.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">He speaking different African languages “Zulu,Xhosa,Afrikaans,” and nice English save 
            <br>him in different conditions especially when he met some of the boys in the street and<br>
             they started talking in “Zulu” language playing to harm him but he heard them speaking 
             <br>and he responded back to them in the same language. Also him knowing the different language 
            <br>helped him to love my classmates and make friends instead of enemies since he was a colored kid.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Trevor Noah used humor in page:5 to describe when he had been thrown from a moving 
        <br>car, He said his mother Patricia threw him out of the moving car and  hit the ground and rolled 
        <br>for a bit like rubbish and he walked up and ran away with his mother like nothing happened .
         <br>It was on Sunday when they were from the church to home.That saved them from the bad <br>men who world have harmed them.

        <h3>Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife. For a long time I 
            wondered why he ever married a woman like my mom in the first place, as she was the 
            opposite of that in every way. If he wanted a woman to bow to him, there were plenty of 
            girls back in Tzaneen being raised solely for that purpose. The way my mother always 
            explained it, the traditional man wants a woman to be subservient, but he never falls 
            in love with subservient women. He’s attracted to independent women. “He’s like an exotic 
            bird collector,” she said. “He only wants a woman who is free because his dream is to put 
            her in a cage. Trevor Noah in Born a Crime</h3>
    
            <p>From the look of things according to the Born a Crime book, I see Abel wanted a 
                <br>traditional marriage with a traditional wife because he needed a wife who will have no voice,
                <br> rights or suggestions in his life.He wanted to be the head of the family and 
                <br>no one in the family could be right apart from him.</p>
    
                <p>In the book Abel wanted to own and be the ruler of everything in the house, Trevor Noah 
                    <br>explained  Abel’s presence in the house brought with him new rules.One of the first things<br> 
                    he did was he kicked Fufi and Panther out of the house. And said “No dogs in the house”in an 
                    <br>African home, dogs sleep outside, people sleep inside. And slowly he stopped Noah and 
                    <br>his mother from going to Church.Saying “My wife will not be at the church the whole day”.
                    <br> According to me I see he was not a good man because he shouldn't have introduced all those<br>
                     rules since Patricia is a great and educated woman who should be able to enjoy her<br> 
                    freedom because she knew what she was doing.</p>
    
                    <p>According to Born a Crime, I see Abel, like a villager, thought he was an educated man,<br> 
                        he still behaved and thought like an uneducated person. He wanted his wife to bow<br> 
                        and respect him while he didn't show that to her and I can say he had a high temper<br>
                         where sometimes he beat Patricia when he drank and when Patricia tried to correct him.</p>
    
                         <p>
                            I feel that Abel didn’t really love,care or trust Patricia or her Child. The way he was<br>limiting
                            their freedom of movement and other things they were doing before, for example<br> 
                            he refused to give Patricia and Trevor a ride to visit Noah’s dad when Patricia’s car broke down 
                            <br>he said “How can I take my wife and her child and drop you off there? 
                            <br>You’re insulting me, what do I tell my friends and family?
                            </p>
    
                            <p>
                                For an educated or caring man he could always accept corrections and understand his 
                                <br>family especially his wife.<br>
                                I always want to see all women around the world being respected and valued in the 
                                <br>community and given rights or taking part in leadership just like men because I personally
                                 <br>believe that what a man can do we are in a position of doing it better when trusted and given time.
                                 <br> Some men like Abel should change and treat their women better mainly in African society.
                                </p>
